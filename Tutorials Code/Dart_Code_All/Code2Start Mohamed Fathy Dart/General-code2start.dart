/// Important Concepts [6]
/// Dart Is Strongly Type
/// Any Thing Is Obj
/// There Are Two Types Of Problems => Warning , errors
/// warning => there is an error but app work but may be carsh later
/// errors => 1- error[in  compile time code will not be compiled] 
/// 2- exception [In Run Time]
/// There Are Two Types Of Data => 
/// 1- Primitive Exists before => String, Int, Bool, ..
/// 2- Non-Primitive => Custom Types => Classes 
/// 


/// Lexical Scope [24]
/// Global Scope, Inside Main, Nested Scope, Nested Nested Scope => Called Lexical Scp
/// All Func will be Executed  Must Called In The Scope Which Exits And In The Nested 


/// Lexical Closure [25]


/// Arithmetic Ope  [26]
///  /  => Result Assigned To Be  Double
///  ~/ => Result Assigned To Be Int [Take Alhasel And Leave The Remainder == modulas]
///  %  => Take The Remainder

/// Unary Ope [27] 
/// Unary Ope => Increament && Decreament

/// Equality, Relational Ope [28]
///   ==,       <, >, <>= 

///  Callable Classes [61]
/// call obj like a func so you Need to implement call method 
/// call method can take Params 
/// In Case Of Return In Call Method You Can Remove Its Type [ Compiler Infer Type]
